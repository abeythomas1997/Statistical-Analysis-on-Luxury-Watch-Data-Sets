Explain the sampling method if known. Ensure you reference the data source if you have used Open Data. List and explain the important variables. Explain everything that you do to preprocess the data.

4- Descriptive Statistics and Visualisation [Plain text & R code & Output]: Summarise the important variables in your investigation. Use visualisation to highlight interesting features of the data and tell the overall story. Explain how you dealt with data issues (if any), e.g. missing data and outliers.

Between Task 5, 6, and 7, you can choose any two of them for your assignment. You do not need to include all three tasks.

5- Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Interval [Plain text & R code & Output]: Apply an appropriate hypothesis test and confidence interval for your investigation. Ensure you state the hypotheses and check any assumptions. Report the appropriate values and interpret the results.

6- Categorical association [Plain text & R code & Output]: Apply an appropriate categorical association for your investigation. Report the appropriate values and interpret the results.
